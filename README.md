# git-commit-art
Python script that manipulates commits in a new repository to create images in GitHub's contribution history

I only started really uisng GitHub recently, meaning my GitHub contribution history is pretty barren, so in an effort to make it look a little more interesting I created this script. Currently only contains 2D array to create a Space Invader ship. Looking to add more images and ability to take an image file input and convert to 2D array of pixel darkness that can be used by the script.
